# 🔢 Even or Odd Without Modulus

## 📌 Problem Statement
Write a Python program to check whether a given integer is **even** or **odd** **without using the modulus (`%`) operator**.

The program should determine the result using alternative arithmetic or logical operations.

---

## Input Format
- A single integer `N` provided as input.

---

## Output Format
- Print `Even` if the number is even.
- Print `Odd` if the number is odd.

---

## 🚫 Restrictions
- The `%` (modulus) operator must **not** be used.

---

## Constraints
- `-10⁹ ≤ N ≤ 10⁹`

---

# Sample Input 1

10

# Sample Output 1

10 is an even number.

---

# Sample Input 2

11

# Sample Output 2

11 is an odd number.

## 🏷️ Difficulty Level
**Easy**

---

## Explanation
- Even numbers are divisible by `2`.
- Odd numbers are not divisible by `2`.
- Since the modulus operator is restricted, the program must use other methods such as division or bitwise operations to determine the result.
