# 🔵 Area and Circumference of a Circle

## 📌 Problem Statement
Write a Python program to compute the **area** and **circumference** of a circle given its **radius**.

Use the constant `pi` from the built-in `math` module for calculations.

---

## Input Format
- A single floating-point number `R` representing the radius of the circle.

---

## Output Format
Print **two lines**:
1. Area of the circle
2. Circumference of the circle

---

## Constraints
- `0 ≤ R ≤ 10⁶`

---

### Sample Input
```
7
```

---

### Sample Output
```
153.94
43.98
```

---

## 🧠 Explanation
- Area of a circle is calculated using the formula:  
  **Area = π × R²**
- Circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula:  
  **Circumference = 2 × π × R**
- The value of π should be obtained using `math.pi`.
