# 🔢 Find the Larger Number (Without max())

## 📌 Problem Statement
Write a Python program that accepts **two numbers** and prints the larger one **without using the built-in `max()` function**.

The comparison must be performed using conditional statements.

---

## Input Format
- Line 1: First number `A`
- Line 2: Second number `B`

---

## Output Format
- Print the larger of the two numbers.

---

## Constraints
- `-10⁶ ≤ A, B ≤ 10⁶`

### Sample Input 1
```
10
20
```

### Sample Output 1
```
20
```

---

### Sample Input 2
```
-10
-12
```

### Sample Output 2
```
-10
```

---

### Sample Input 3
```
12
12
```

### Sample Output 3
```
12
```

## 🧠 Explanation
- The program should compare the two values using relational operators.
- Built-in helper functions like `max()` are not allowed.
- If both numbers are equal, either value may be printed.
