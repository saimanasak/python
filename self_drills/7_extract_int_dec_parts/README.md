# 🔢 Extract Integer and Decimal Parts

## 📌 Problem Statement
Write a Python program that accepts a **floating-point number** and extracts its:

1. **Integer part**
2. **Decimal part**

The extraction must be performed using **mathematical operations only**, without converting the number to a string.

---

### Input Format
- A single floating-point number `N`.

---

### Output Format
Print **two lines**:
1. Integer part of the number
2. Decimal part of the number

---

## Constraints
- `-10⁶ ≤ N ≤ 10⁶`

---

## Sample Input
```
123.456
```

---

## Sample Output
```
123
0.456
```

---

## 🧠 Explanation
- The integer part represents the whole-number portion of the input.
- The decimal part represents the fractional portion after removing the integer component.
- String-based operations are not allowed; only arithmetic or math-based methods should be used.
