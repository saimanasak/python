## 🏷️ Difficulty
Problems in this repository are categorized by difficulty to provide a **conceptual framework for progression**, rather than a fixed sequence.

- **Easy** – Covers foundational Python concepts such as syntax, basic operations, and control structures.
- **Medium** 
- **Advanced**

All difficulty levels are **actively in progress**, and problems may be added across levels as learning evolves.

This flexible classification supports both **focused practice** and **exploratory learning**, allowing concepts to be revisited and deepened over time.
