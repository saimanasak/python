# 🧠 Python Self Drills – Problem Index

This folder contains a collection of **Python practice problems**, organized from basic to expert level.  
Each problem has its own folder with:
- Problem statement (`README.md`)
- Python solution file(s)

Use this index to quickly navigate through the problems.

## 🏷️ Difficulty Classification
Problems in this are categorized by difficulty to provide a **conceptual framework for learning**, rather than a strict progression path.

- **Beginner** – Focuses on absolute fundamentals such as basic syntax, input/output, arithmetic operations, and simple conditionals.
- **Easy** – Reinforces core Python concepts including control flow, basic data structures, and common built-in functions.
- **Medium** – Explores intermediate topics such as collections, modular programming, and applied logical problem-solving.
- **Advanced** – Emphasizes complex problem-solving, performance considerations, and real-world application of Python concepts.
- **Challenge** – Consists of open-ended or non-trivial problems that require deeper reasoning, experimentation, or multiple approaches.

All difficulty levels are **actively in progress**, and problems may be added across levels as learning evolves.

This flexible classification supports both **focused practice** and **exploratory learning**, allowing concepts to be revisited and deepened over time.

## 📌 Overview
- Each problem is organized into its own directory with a dedicated `README.md` that clearly defines the objective and expected behavior.
- Folder names are numbered for clarity and ease of navigation, not as a strict indicator of difficulty progression.
- Solutions emphasize **clarity, correctness, and maintainability**, with an intention to reflect good coding practices.
- This is a **living workspace**, continuously evolving as new topics are explored and understanding deepens.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
The problems and solutions in this are curated based on **personal learning interests and practice goals**. 
 
There is no fixed roadmap, and content may change as learning progresses.

Problem selection, difficulty classification, and solution approaches may evolve over time as understanding deepens and new concepts are explored.  

This is intended as a **learning workspace** rather than an authoritative reference.
