# 🔢 Round a Float to Two Decimal Places

## 📌 Problem Statement
Write a Python program that accepts a **floating-point number** and rounds it to **2 decimal places** using:

1. The built-in `round()` function  
2. A formatted string method  

The program should display the results of **both approaches**.

---

## Input Format
- A single floating-point number `N` provided as input.

---

## Output Format
Print **two lines**:
1. The value rounded to 2 decimal places using `round()`
2. The value rounded to 2 decimal places using formatted string output

---

## Constraints
- `-10⁶ ≤ N ≤ 10⁶`

---

## Sample Input

3.14159

---

## Sample Output
- 3.14
- 3.14

---

## 🧠 Explanation
- `round(N, 2)` rounds the number to two decimal places.
- Formatted string output (such as using format specifiers) ensures the number is displayed with exactly two digits after the decimal point.
- Both methods may appear similar in output but are implemented differently internally.
